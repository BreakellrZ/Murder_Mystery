# Hallow Halls Murder Mystery Game

![Hallow Halls ascii art](documentation/hallow_halls.png)

- Hallow Halls is a murder mystery game. The game is set at a very wealthy private pyschiatric Hospital called Hallow Halls. The aim of the game is to find out who was the murderer.
As you play the game, you will come across new clues, and items that will help you figure out who is the killer. You will be choosing which room you want to explore next by typing the room into the terminal provided. Some rooms will contain items that will be added to your inventory. You will need all 8 items before guessing who you think is the murderer. Read every detail carefully as it may or may not be very important to solve the case... you might even have to solve a little riddle along the way. I recommend users to play some sort of detective music in the background while playing the game.

## Design of the project

### Strategy

My overall strategy was to make a fun, challenging murder mystery for the users to play with some twists and to get the user really thinking about who the murdere could be.

- The game was aimed at mainly ages that are 12+ as it does involve a murder and some complexity.

- I wanted the feel to be of an eery Psychiatric Hospital.

- I wanted the users to get immersed in this experience and recommend users to play some sort of detective music in the background.

### Structure

The structure of the game is very simple. At the top of each scene the user will have their inventory, riddle, and clues section with colors of green, yellow and cyan. Then below that, will be the main story being printed out for the users to see the story and what is being said in bright white text. Then at the bottom there will be a paragraph which will explain to them which room they have a choice of going into next which will be in blue.

### Surface

On the surface I used colorama to add some color to the game. I used the colors green for the inventory, the intro welcome message and also for the congratulations message if you won the game. I used red for invalid inputs - a message would pop up in red saying "invalid input". I used yellow for the riddle and I used cyan for the clues. I used Style.BRIGHT for all the main text and input fields to make it easier to read. I also added some custom Ascii Art at the beginning of the game in the color red, the typography was 'bloody' to give the game more of a horror vibe.
