- Hallow Halls is a murder mystery game. The game is set at a very wealthy private pyschiatric Hospital called Hallow Halls. The aim of the game is to find out who was the murderer.
As you play the game, you will come across new clues, and items that will help you figure out who is the killer. You will be choosing which room you want to explore next by typing the room into the terminal provided. Some rooms will contain items that will be added to your inventory. You will need all 8 items before guessing who you think is the murderer. Read every detail carefully as it may or may not be very important to solve the case... you might even have to solve a little riddle along the way.
